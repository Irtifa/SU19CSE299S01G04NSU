<h1>Project Details</h1> <br>
<h2>Project name: Orphanage Management System </h2> <br>
<h6 align='justify'>Orphanage management system is a website interconnecting our nation’s NGOs, civil society and orphanages to eradicate the hopeless conditions of the orphanages due to lack of proper communication between donors and receivers and seeking parents. There are a lot of orphanages existing at this current time and there are a lot of eager parents and donors to help these orphanages prosper. Orphans Hope is the platform were these two parties with a mutual interest meet and take conclusive decisions to reach their desired goals in an effective and authentic manner.
So this is a website where people can find their necessary information together.
This is website based project so that interested people about orphanage so that they do not need to browse dozens of website .Sometimes they don’t even find the right information .For them this website is a very good option.
For this, we will collect data from real orphanage owner and update our information page. Interested parents will go through the information and policies about adoption and donation. So that they may get easily adaption details. Their information will all hide and only the orphanage owner will see this.</h6>

There are 2 types of register. One is admin another is orphanage owner. Orphanage owner can see the interested parents provided information. donation information can see the admin. The rest development need more advanced code and authorizations.</h6>
